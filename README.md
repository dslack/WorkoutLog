WorkoutLog
==========

We will use a simple JSON file to store a sample of the P90X worksheet, see http://zillafitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/New_P90X_Worksheets_Chad_Pink_2014.pdf

This app will allow the user to select a specific workout regime, and will show their history.  The user will be able to add a log of their workout.

There are four types of workouts - With Reps, with Reps and Weight, Left/Right and Reps Timed.

Each of these types will have a slightly different interface.

Finally, we will store these in Local Storage (with a clear button)
